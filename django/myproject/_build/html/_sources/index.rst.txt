   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to GfLibrary's documentation!
=====================================

This page was created to keep track of every single one of the books from Genovefaâ€™s large and beautiful collection of books. 
Obviously the collection is growing every year by shelves, so it is impossible to keep track of borrowed books in paper agenda 
(also it is much more stylish to have a web application).
