### Web Programming project, winter semester 2016

##### Project topic
Genovefa has quite a large and interesting collection of books at home. Despite the emergence of all kinds of electronic readers, she believes that the paper has still its charm (it is easier keep a broken table in balance with the help of book than with Kindle). Genovefa's collection of books is appreciated by her friends, because in this way they can get to bestsellers better than in the library. Unfortunately, Genovefa significantly better remember the content of books than a person who has a book borrowed.

Help her to solve her problem with a web application that will remembere all of the book colletion. The application allows the entry of a new book (any book being entred gets its unique number), you can even enable displaying label or card for each book.

In addition, the app also allows you to record the records of the loan (ie, who borrowed which book and when). History of rentals for a single book should be maintained.

Genovefa's friends could enable search in the database of books and review statuses (if a book is borrowed or not).

The app also offers to display various statistics (who borrows a book often, who currently has the most borrowed books, ...).

The application should be written in a way that will allow the rental of other things (eg. CDs, tools, ...)
